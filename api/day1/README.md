In simple terms, an API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for one program or app to talk to another. Itâ€™s like a bridge or a messenger that helps two things exchange information smoothly.

In this case backend and frontend, basically the api provide a secure way to transmit required data to frontend. In the above example it just return a `Hello World!` but in complex program we can configure to fetch some data from db or do some backend operation which are not possible in frontend (the browser).
